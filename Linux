Open your Terminal window, navigate to your Downloads folder and list all the files:

$ cd Downloads
$ ls -l
  uPyCraft_linux_V1.X
You should have a similar file (uPyCraft_linux_V1.X) in your Downloads folder. You need to make that file executable with the following command:

$ chmod +x uPyCraft_linux_V1.X
Then, to open/run the uPyCraft IDE software, type the next command:

$ ./uPyCraft_linux_V1.X


Weâ€™ll be using this software to flash our ESP based boards with MicroPython firmware as well as to program the boards.
